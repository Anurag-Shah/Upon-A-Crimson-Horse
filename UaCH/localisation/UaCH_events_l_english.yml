 UaCH.1.t: "The Ailing Emperor"
 UaCH.1.d: "Early in 1444, @TIM §GShah Rukh Mirza§!, ruler of the Timurid empire, youngest son of §GTimur§!, has fallen ill. While the nature of his illness is not disclosed outside his court, news are spreading that he will not survive the year. This news had sent the royal family and the high nobles into a frenzied preparation for chaos, as Shah Rukh's designated successor has died a few years prior. Many elders still remember the days after Timurs death followed by a decade of campaigning before relative peace could return to the land.\n\nIn the north, one of Shah Rukhs children, the scholarly @TRS §GUlugh beg§! and his ambitious son §GAbdal Latif§!, long time viceroy of §YTransoxiana§! are already putting plans in motion.\n\nThe de facto independent prince of §YAjam§!, @QOM §GSultan Muhammad§! is eyeing the neighbouring §YIsfahan§!, where the old and decrepit @ISF §GMahmudshah§! is still clinging to power.\n\nShah Rukh's favorite son @BLK §GMuhammad Juki§!, the governor of §YBalkh§! is more than willing to step up, but there are rumors about him being ill too.\n\nAnother grandson, amir of §YHerat§!, @HER §GAla al-Dawla Mirza§! is also watching the throne with interest and gathering his armies, with the full support of his grandmother, Shah Rukhs chief consort §GGawhar Shad§!."

 UaCH.612.d: "A mixture of bureaucratic corruption, and the lack of a well accepted successor to the Timurid Realm, has stirred anger in Isfahan. It seems that a conspiracy has formed to oppose us during Shah Rukh's illness, and we have little ability to project our own power and put a stop to this in our current state. If they do declare their independence, our armies must march to put a stop to this, but will Shah Rukh be fit to lead his armies into such a battle?\n\n Our grandson, Sultan Muhammad of Ajam, is carefully watching these developments. Should he use this war as an excuse to press his claim, we must quickly crush his rebellion, so that the other Princes do not get any ideas."

 UaCH.25.t: "The Succession Crisis"
 UaCH.25.d: "Since the death of the most esteemed Emperor §GShah Rukh§!, the tension between his family members has been ever growing. His long illness emboldened the Princes, and now they're putting plans long years in the making into motion, while local governors and minor officials are also sensing an opportunity to carve a small cut of the pie for themselves. Brothers turn against cusins, fathers go to war against their own ambitious children, and those with sharp eyes can even see the hands of the spymasters slowly caressing the threads in the background. \n\nThe flame has been ignited, and may grow into a firestorm burning the Empire of Timur down."

Abdal-Latif also abolished the tamgha tax on trade in order to gain popular support, and protected his rear by promising §GAbu'l Qasim Babur§! that he would block any moves by his father to take §YKhorasan§! back. The opposition became so openly known that in the early summer, that §GUlugh Beg§! prepared to move against his own son, with his forces including the forces of §GAbd Allah§!, who brought many of the emirs exiled from Fars during §GSultan Muhammad's§! conquests."

The dying prince entrusted to Ulugh Beg the guardianship of his son §GAbu Sa'id Mirza§!, who was then raised under his care. Abu Sa'id was given a role at Ulugh Beg's court, steadly rising among the courtly ranks. Now that he is a grown man, it is time to be given higher duties."

 UaCH.34.t: "Rewarding Abu Sa'id"
 UaCH.34.d: "Impeccable service. There are few in our court that would deserve such a praise, yet §GAbu Sa'id§! is definitely the foremost of them. His work throughout the years has been exemplary, handling both diplomatic, administrative and military matters with equal ease. Recently, he personally led a guard force against an invading tribe, decisively defeating them and even captured the leader himself. His actions should merit the highest of rewards from us, yet his personal power is already growing considerably.... "

Though it seems all of this was in vain, as even someone as loyal as §GAbu Sa'id§! seems to have developed new ideas.

We've already recieved words of support from the rivals of the Khans in Chimgi-Tura, and, as such, it is now time to determine how we shall handle these mistreatments and injustices.\n\nShall we take these men, who seek the downfall of the Shaybanids, up on their word and plot to seize the reins of rulership for ourselves, or shall we just pray that the situation changes?"

 UaCH.60.t: "The Great Migration"
 UaCH.60.d: "It appears the discontent of the Kazakh tribes has boiled over, with the two co-chieftains, Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan, having begun a migration into the lands of Mogulistan, seeking support from abroad. They still claim their lands under our rule as theirs despite the migration, which is clearly a vagrant act of disobidience on top of the migration out of our lands into the lands of one of our enemies.\n\nWhilst this has soured our relations with them, the bigger concern is how the Khans of Moghulistan will respond. Should they back this act of rebellion, it is likely that the Kazakhs will grow to become a threat to our hold on power in the region, and may even give the Taighuibs of Sibir, who have been quelled for the mean time, ideas."
 UaCH.60.a: "Let them run... we will wait."

 UaCH.61.t: "The Great Migration"
 UaCH.61.d: "It appears that the Kazakh khans have grown tired of being naught but a small corner of a growing tribal power on the Steppe, and have left for greener pastures elsewhere, namely, our own lands. They request that we give them our support in a future war of reconquest against the Shaybanids, who are likely to attempt to press claim to the lands they have largely left behind. By granting them our support, we will gain a powerful ally, but will also end up hurting ourselves to assist 2 khans who may end up being nothing more than vipers that will suck us dry and leave us for dead."

 UaCH.62.t: "Care of the Empress-Dowager"
 UaCH.62.d: "In Shah Rukh's twilight years full of illness, Gawhar Shad has grown to become his main caretaker. Whilst not particularly unusual, the closeness the two share is rather unusual, given that the marriage started political in nature in order for a group of notables in Herat to appease Shah Rukh. However, the reason for the marriage matters not anymore, for the two truly care for eachother, and Gawhar Shad has taken more responsibility than ever before to ensure that order is maintained.\n\nWhilst all know that Shah Rukh's time looms, it is Gawhar Shad who has arguably kept him alive for this long, despite her schemeing regarding his succession. No doubt that Shah Rukh is grateful to have someone who cares enough to be by his side even as he nears his final breath."
 UaCH.62.a: "A truly beautiful marriage of love."

 UaCH.63.t: "Patronage of Shah Rukh and Gawhar Shad"
 UaCH.63.d: "If there is one thing that Shah Rukh has become known for, it's the patronage of the arts and Persian culture that has occurred under his rule, with the assistance of his favorite wife, Gawhar Shad. The court has been moved from Samarkand to Herat in order to better establish a Persianized state, the Persian language has replaced Chagatai as the main language of government, and a vibrant court of artists, architects, and poets has been maintained. Under their joint patronage, elaborate mosques have been built in Herat and Mashhad, with a distinct mixture of cultural styles. Literature, much like government, has become primarily Persian once more, with Chagatai and Arabic still holding major sway as well. Islamic law has superseded the Mongol law Timur put in place, and the state has become far more concerned with portraying itself as a proper Iranian state. Already, Iran has once again began to prosper, and if Shah Rukh's successor keeps this patronage of the arts in place, it is likely that the Timurid state will become not unlike those before it that became nothing more than another Persian empire.\n\nSadly, given the scheming of the Princes, this prosperity seems to be nothing but a brief glimmer of hope..."

 UaCH.97.d: "With the recent death of our ruler, it seems our reforms grow less and less popular. Our vassals scheme and plot at our demise. The future grows ever bleaker, and it becomes more and more imperative that we reform our state as soon as we are able."

 UaCH.98.t: "Upon a Crimson Horse: Crisis Mechanics"
 UaCH.105.t: "Upon a Crimson Horse: Crisis Mechanics"
 UaCH.98.d: "§RIf this is your first time playing the 'Upon a Crimson Horse' mod, it may be helpful to read this explanation.§!\n\nThe Second Timurid Succession Crisis, historically, was a major conflict that followed shortly after the death of Shah Rukh Mirza. In Upon a Crimson Horse, this is modelled with a major conflict that involves all states under the Timurid Umbrella being at war with each other. In this conflict, the goal is to defeat the other nations and decide your path forward, either through the §GReclaim Timur's Legacy§! or §GEnd Timur's Legacy§! Mechanics (available in the Special Mechanics UI screen, which you can access from the tab on the bottom of your screen).\n\nIn the civil war, there are 3 types of participants. §GPrinces§! are Timurid States that are ruled by a member of the Timurid Dynasty. §GGovernors§! are Timurid states that are ruled by a local governor. Finally, §GInterlopers§! are outside powers that choose to become involved in the Civil War. Typically, all §GPrinces§! and all non-subject §GGovernors§! will be at war with each other, but §GInterlopers§! join the war to seize a particular region and will only be at war with powers that hold land in that region. You can see §GPrinces§! and §GGovernors§! on the left and right of the Succession Crisis UI screen respectively, and you can see any §GInterlopers§! with their shield on the region they have declared their intervention for.\n\nProgressing in the Succession Crisis involves subjugating your enemies. For this purpose, your wars have 2 new peace offers: §YSubdue Claimant§! and §YEnforce Loyalty§!, both of which will force the other country to become your §GEmirate§!, and join your wars §R(note: this is sometimes buggy)§!. These peace deals also do not incur any aggressive expansion: it is, after all, a civil war (so, avoid using vassalization, or you will end up in a coalition quickly)."
 UaCH.105.d: "The only way to end the civil war is through the mechanics in the Succession Crisis UI. §GRestore Timur's Legacy§! requires you to be a Timurid §GPrince§! and the sole Timurid Power left, and stabilizes the Timurid realm. §GEnd Timur's Legacy§! requires you to be a §GGovernor§! or §GInterloper§!, and have defeated each of the princes. Playing a §GGovernor§! but want to §GRestore Timur's Legacy§! instead? Well, you can always §GEnthrone a Timurid Claimant§! and elevate yourself to a §GPrince§!.\n\nUnless you use one of these mechanics, peace is temporary. A peace deal that does not involve the subjugation of your enemy is merely a temporary ceasefire, and hostilities will resume soon enough, as long as both powers stay independent. It may be useful to get a ceasefire or accede to some minor demands, and focus down some enemies, before going back to the trickier ones.\n\nIf you are playing an outsider, and want to get involved in the crisis, you need to border the Timurid Realm. Then, you will get access to the Succession Crisis Mechanics UI, from which you can select the option to §GIntervene§! and become an interloper. You will be able to choose a region to declare for, as long as you border that region.\n\nIf the campaign goes poorly and you find your capital occupied and are on the brink of defeat, do not worry. You can always §GAbandon your Claims§!, letting you flee to India and start again.\n\nI hope you enjoy playing Upon a Crimson Horse!"

 UaCH.99.d: "§RIf this is your first time playing the 'Upon a Crimson Horse' mod, it may be helpful to read this explanation.§!\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully stabilized the Timurid Realm by §GReclaiming Timur's Legacy§! Your troubles are now all over. Wait, what's that? Another ticking disaster? What is going on, I thought we just won?\n\nHistorically, the Second Timurid Succession Crisis was shortly followed by the Third Timurid Succession Crisis, a much longer and more devestating version of the same, which lasted until the state was conquered fully by outside powers. In 'Upon a Crimson Horse', this is modeled through a repeatable disaster, that slowly ticks up after you §GReclaim Timur's Legacy§! and will keep firing until the government is reformed, or until the Timurid Realm is fully conquered by outside powers. So then, how does one reform the state and escape this cycle?\n\nA new government mechanic has appeared in your state. Through this meter, your level of Persianization, you have two paths forward to reform. At §G100§! Persianization, you will be able to reform into a centralized, Persian state, and leave the legacy of the Timurids far behind you. At §R-100§! Persianization, you will be able to realize Timur's ambition, and become a centralized Horde in the image of your Mongol ancestors. Choose your path wisely: once you commit to one, you will not have enough time to switch before the disaster strikes.\n\nWill you reform at any cost, or will your state once again succumb to a devestating succession Crisis?\n\n§RYou may notice a 'bug' in your tier 2 government reform. This is a paradox bug and is the only way to implement the persianization feature without a crash. You will get your normal tier 2 reform back soon!§!\n\n§RIf you do NOT see the new government mechanics (the Persianization Meter) in your government tab, please save and reload your game, or at worst, an older autosave. This is a rare bug that can occur.§!"

He states that he is the true successor of §GShah Rukh§!, and has declared his rebellion against us, with the full intention of capturing the Timurid Throne. This is intolerable, and he must be quickly defeated.\n\n§RIf the Timurid Succession Crisis starts before we defeat Sultan Muhammad, the war will be replaced by the succession crisis wars. Historically, though Shah Rukh was able to defeat Ajam, he could not track down and kill Sultan Muhammad before his own death, and Sultan Muhammad remained a significant contender in the Timurid Succession Crisis§!"

 uach_reform.1000.d: "The Shia faith, while a minority in our country, has recently become a thorn in our side. Their prosletyzing has raised eyebrows in our court, especially among the Ulama. Inaction will certainly create opposition to us in our court. However, cracking down on this conversion will draw the ire of the new converts."

 uach_reform.1006.d: "Recently, an issue surrounding the fasting period of Ramazan has come to the forefront of court politics. The Ulama insist that as pious Muslims, all must take part in the fast. But many of our Princes and Nobles, aligning more closely to their Mongol or Turkmen roots, only pay lip service to the fasting, and even indulge in daytime feasts. Both sides have come to us, demanding we take a stance on the matter."

 uach_reform.1008.d: "Our efforts to deal with the Turkmen raids have had little impact. Furthermore, a new ruler has arisen in the west, who seems to have territorial aspirations on our land. Uzun Hasan, as he is known, is extremely unpopular in our court. Some of our Monarch's closest advisors have suggested a campaign against the Turkmen: to teach them their place, and to reconquer some of the land Timur once held. But a few in the court see this as a ridiculous expense and dangerous proposition, and say we should focus on our internal situation instead. What will our path forward be?"
 uach_reform.1008.a: "It is time to teach these Turkmen a lesson"
 uach_reform.1008.b: "We have bigger things to worry about"
 uach_reform.1009.t: "The Language of the Timurid Court"
 uach_reform.1009.d: "In our country, two langauges are spoken among the upper classes, and within our court. There is Chagatai, a Turkic language spoken by the Mongols of old in the once-mighty Chagatai Khanate. There is also Persian, the language of the people, and a language connected to a rich literary and cultural tradition, that would be a great benefit to our state. As the ruler, it is up to us to prioritize the language we prefer."

The Al Saray Palace, planned to be built in Shahrisabz, the birthplace of Timur himself, is an ambitious project that will no doubt cost us dearly to build. While it would be unpopular in the court, it would certainly help us assert our power and independence."

 uach_reform.1012.d: "Our ruler's interest in agriculture and farming is well known to all. His focus on the welfare of the peasants has not been overly popular in the court but has been a matter of great pride among the common people, and has greatly increased the stability of our realm. This time, the Royal Architects propose a major dam construction on the Golestan River, combined with irrigation systems (including the Juy-i Sultani Canal near Herat), and several tax provisions, to encourage more farming in the west of our realm. Shall we give these plans the royal stamp?"
