  UaCH.1.t:0 "The Ailing Emperor"
  UaCH.1.d:0 "Early in 1444, §GShah Rukh Mirza§!, ruler of the Timurid empire, youngest son of §GTimur§!, has fallen ill. While the nature of his illness is not disclosed outside his court, news are spreading that he will not survive the year. This news had sent the royal family and the high nobles into a frenzied preparation for chaos, as Shah Rukh's designated successor has died a few years prior. Many elders still remember the days after Timurs death followed by a decade of campaigning before relative peace could return to the land.\n\nIn the north, Shah Rukhs last surviving child, the scholarly §GUlugh beg§! and his ambitious son §GAbdal Latif§!, long time viceroy of §YTransoxiana§! are already putting plans in motion.\n The de facto independent prince of §YAjam§!, §GSultan Muhammad§! is eyeing the neighbouring §YIsfahan§!, where the old and decrepit §GMahmudshah§! is still clinging to power.\nShah Rukh's favorite grandson §GMuhammad Juki§!, the governor of §YBalkh§! is more than willing to step up, but there are rumors about him being ill too.\nAnother grandson, amir of §YHerat§!, §GAla al-Dawla Mirza§! is also eyeing the throne and gathering his armies, with the full support of his grandmother,Shah Rukhs chief consort §GGawhar Shad§! ."

Possibly in an effort to back his own claim to the throne, or that of his father, §GUlugh Beg§!. For now, the funeral procession has stalled, as boths sides are awaiting reinforcements."
 UaCH.17.a:0"Intolerable!"
 UaCH.17.b:0"I'm dying of shame."

 UaCH.18.t:0"A Chance to Return"
 UaCH.18.d:0"Grave news! Sultan Muhammad, upon hearing of Shah Rukh’s death, marches east, retaking Ajam and becoming the Timurid Emperor of Fars.

Whilst Isfahan enjoys a tax relief, other regions suffered immensely, with Yazd being heavily taxed, with its emirs being frequently replaced."
 UaCH.18.a:0"I will not be denied!"
 ## player should swap to Sultan Muhammad (QOM)
 UaCH.18.b:0"Hey, Gurkani, get this idiot for us."
 ## Should still release QOM
 
 UaCH.19.t:0"Return of Sultan Muhammad"
 UaCH.19.d:0"The strangest news! Sultan Muhammad, upon hearing of Shah Rukh’s death, marches east, retaking Ajam and becoming the Timurid Emperor of Fars. He rewarded the surviving nobles of Isfahan, and many nobles of other regions defected to him. Whilst Isfahan enjoys a tax relief, other regions suffered immensely, with Yazd being heavily taxed, with its emirs being frequently replaced. Now he has sent letters to us for aid once again, promising handsome rewards."
 UaCH.19.a:0"Our rightful suzerain has returned!"
 UaCH.19.b:0"That loser is back again?"
 
 UaCH.20.t:0"Return of Sultan Muhammad"
 UaCH.20.d:0"Sultan Muhammad seems to have forgotten the beating he received last time, as he has rebelled once again. His ragtag armies are bolstered by foreign mercenaries, yet some of our nobles still believe he has a chance to win..."
 UaCH.20.a:0"You sure are a glutton for punishment.."
 UaCH.20.b:0"We do not have the strength to fight at this moment."
 
 UaCH.21.t:0"Raids from Balkh"
 UaCH.21.d:0"Muhammad Juki's son, Abu Bakr, governor of Balkh has launched multiple raids through the border to Transoxiana. While a minor annoyance at first, the attacks soon grew both in boldness and cruelty, until we have managed to capture him a battle."
 UaCH.21.a:0"Demand that Balkh surrender to us."
 UaCH.21.b:0"We must keep the peace."

 UaCH.22.t:0"Ultimatum"
 UaCH.22.d:0"The Prince of Transoxiana has taken Abu Bakr hostage. With the raids now stopped, this has gone beyond reasonable, yet he sent us an ultimatum to surrender without demands."
 UaCH.22.a:0"We are a Prince of Timur!"
 UaCH.22.b:0"We reap what we sow."
 
 UaCH.23.t:0"A Shattered Peace"
 UaCH.23.d:0"The relatively calm period after the flurry of events when Shah Rukh has died, seems to be over. Raids from Balkh have hit Transoxiana's cities, leaving burning and pillaged land behind. In response, Transoxianan troops have captured the governor of Balkh, Abu Bakr. Maybe we should step in to limit further escalation before its too late?"
 UaCH.23.a:0"Enforce the peace!"
 UaCH.23.b:0"What Abu Bakr has sown, he is reaping now."
 
 UaCH.24.t:0"Demands from Herat"
 UaCH.24.d:0"A letter has arrived today from Herat, demanding the cease of hostilities between us and the Emirate of Balkh. This would be a great opportunity to end the bloodshed without further loss of face.... or a chance to break the chains of Herat holding us back."
 UaCH.24.a:0"If you wish... "
 UaCH.24.b:0"We bow to no one!"
