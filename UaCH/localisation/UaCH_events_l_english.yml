  UaCH.1.d:0 "Early in 1444, §GShah Rukh Mirza§!, ruler of the Timurid empire, youngest son of §GTimur§!, has fallen ill. While the nature of his illness is not disclosed outside his court, news are spreading that he will not survive the year. This news had sent the royal family and the high nobles into a frenzied preparation for chaos, as Shah Rukh's designated successor has died a few years prior. Many elders still remember the days after Timurs death followed by a decade of campaigning before relative peace could return to the land.\n\nIn the north, Shah Rukhs last surviving child, the scholarly §GUlugh beg§! and his ambitious son §GAbdal Latif§!, long time viceroy of §YTransoxiana§! are already putting plans in motion.\n The de facto independent prince of §YAjam§!, §GSultan Muhammad§! is eyeing the neighbouring §YIsfahan§!, where the old and decrepit §GMahmudshah§! is still clinging to power.\nShah Rukh's favorite grandson §GMuhammad Juki§!, the governor of §YBalkh§! is more than willing to step up, but there are rumors about him being ill too.\nAnother grandson, amir of §YHerat§!, §GAla al-Dawla Mirza§! is also eyeing the throne and gathering his armies, with the full support of his grandmother,Shah Rukhs chief consort §GGawhar Shad§! ."

He rewarded the surviving nobles of §YIsfahan§!, and many nobles of other regions defected to him. Whilst §YIsfahan§! enjoys a tax relief, other regions suffered immensely, with §YYazd§! being heavily taxed, with its emirs being frequently replaced.

  UaCH.20.d:0"§GSultan Muhammad§! seems to have forgotten the beating he received last time, as he has rebelled once again. His ragtag armies are bolstered by foreign mercenaries, yet some of our nobles still believe he has a chance to win..."

  UaCH.21.d:0"§GMuhammad Juki's§G son, §GAbu Bakr§!, governor of §YBalkh§! has launched multiple raids through the border to §YTransoxiana§!. While a minor annoyance at first, the attacks soon grew both in boldness and cruelty, until we have managed to capture him a battle."
  UaCH.21.a:0"Demand that Balkh surrender to us."
  UaCH.21.b:0"We must keep the peace."

  UaCH.22.t:0"Ultimatum"
  UaCH.22.d:0"The Prince of §YTransoxiana§! has taken §GAbu Bakr§! hostage. With the raids now stopped, this has gone beyond reasonable, yet he sent us an ultimatum to surrender without demands."
  UaCH.22.a:0"We are a Prince of Timur!"

  UaCH.23.t:0"A Shattered Peace"
  UaCH.23.d:0"The relatively calm period after the flurry of events when §GShah Rukh§! has died, seems to be over. Raids from §YBalkh§! have hit §YTransoxianan§! cities, leaving burning and pillaged land behind. In response, Transoxianan troops have captured the governor of Balkh, §GAbu Bakr§!. Maybe we should step in to limit further escalation before its too late?"
  UaCH.23.a:0"Enforce the peace!"
  UaCH.23.b:0"What Abu Bakr has sown, he is reaping now."
 
  UaCH.24.t:0"Demands from Herat"
  UaCH.24.d:0"A letter has arrived today from Herat, demanding the cease of hostilities between us and the Emirate of §YBalkh§!. This would be a great opportunity to end the bloodshed without further loss of face.... or a chance to break the chains of Herat holding us back."

  UaCH.25.a:0"To the strongest!"

 
  UaCH.26.t:0"Our position in the Crisis"
  UaCH.26.d:0"As §GAla-al Dawla Mirza§! has prepared to march west to confront §GAbul-Qasim Babur§!, the amirs of both princes urged them to ally, due to §GUlugh Beg’s§! intents to conquer his rivals completely. This leads to Ala al-Dawla Mirza effectively having hegemony over most of the Timurid remains, though this wouldn’t last."
  UaCH.26.a:0"We maintain our allegiance to he who rules in Herat."
  UaCH.26.b:0"The lords of Khorasan shall have our might!"
  UaCH.26.c:0"He who rules in Samarkand shall lead us forward."
  UaCH.26.d:0"This is our chance to expel the sons of Timur! "
 
 
  UaCH.27.t:0"The Rogue Prince"
  UaCH.27.d:0"The Turcomen prince §GYar Ali§!, of House §YQara Qoyunlu§!, who had been in prison, escaped and besieged Herat. Many amongst the populace, including the laborers, numerous artists and sufis are fighting to defend the city, though Yar 'Ali was able to recruit many from the suburbs."
  UaCH.27.a:0"Who does he think he is?"
 
  UaCH.28.t:0"The Rogue Prince in flight"
  UaCH.28.d:0"§GYar Ali§! has been put to flight once again, but the damage is done. We are aware of the support he received from the suburbs, and have to decide what to do with those traitors."
  UaCH.28.a:0"Set my men upon the city."
  UaCH.28.b:0"Clearly, I must earn the trust of the suburbs. "
 
  UaCH.29.t:0"Raids!"
  UaCH.29.d:0"The instability of the Empire is a great chance for the neighbouring hordes. Raids are increasing in frequency and severity, even §GUlugh beg's§! palace has been pillaged!"
  UaCH.29.a:0"Enemies everywhere!"
 
  UaCH.30.t:0"The Governance of Balkh"
  UaCH.30.d:0"After the disastrous journey of §GShah Rukh's§! corpse,§GUlugh beg§! has managed to grab power over most of the Empire. Although his son, §GAbdal-Latif§! has played a key role, he feels underappreciated by his father, and haven't been rewarded."
  UaCH.30.a:0"Appoint him as our governor in Balkh."
  UaCH.30.b:0"You see, son, this is how your grandfather failed..."
 
  UaCH.31.t:0"Rumors of Rebellion"
  UaCH.31.d:0"Hurt and upset, §GAbdal-Latif§! began to gather people loyal to him in order to overthrow his father, with the Barlas and Tarkhan emirs pushing him to rebel. Abdal-Latif also abolished the tamgha tax on trade in order to gain popular support, and protected his rear by promising §GAbu'l Qasim Babur§! that he would block any moves by his father to take §YKhorasan§! back. The opposition became so openly known that in the early summer, that §GUlugh Beg§! prepared to move against his own son, with his forces including the forces of §GAbd Allah§!, who brought many of the emirs exiled from Fars during §GSultan Muhammad's§! conquests."
  UaCH.31.a:0"Insolent boy!"
 
  UaCH.32.t:0"Rise of Abu Sa'id Mirza"
  UaCH.32.d:0"During his fatal illness, §GMuhammad Juki§! was visited by his cousin, §GUlugh Beg§!, with whom he had shared a close relationship. The dying prince entrusted to Ulugh Beg the guardianship of his son §GAbu Sa'id Mirza§!, who was then raised under his care. Abu Sa'id was given a role at Ulugh Beg's court, steadly rising among the courtly ranks. Now that he is a grown man, it is time to be given higher duties."
  UaCH.32.a:0"He has inherited his father's skill..."
  UaCH.32.b:0"I'm afraid I cannot entrust you with much, my ward."
 
  UaCH.33.t:0"Service of Abu Sa'id Mirza"
  UaCH.33.d:0"During the years since his appointment, §GAbu Sa'id Mirza§! has performed every single job he was given dutifully. His work ethic is an example to anyone, and he became one of the highly praised and honored member in our court. Now he came to us, asking to be given a higher position, to serve the Empire better."
  UaCH.33.a:0"I shall gladly accept your service."
  UaCH.33.b:0"I'm not sure about this much sway..."
 
  UaCH.34.t:0"Rewarding Abu Sa'id"
  UaCH.34.d:0"Impeccable service. There are few in our court that would deserve such a praise, yet §GAbu Sa'id§! is definitely the foremost of them. His work throughout the years has been exemplary, handling both diplomatic, administrative and military matters with equal ease. Recently, he personally led a guard force against an invading tribe, decisively defeating them and even captured the leader himself. His actions should merit the highest of rewards from us, yet his personal power is already growing considerably....  "
  UaCH.34.a:0"Grant him my daughter's hand in marriage for his good work."
  UaCH.34.b:0"The work should be award enough for someone loyal."
 
  UaCH.35.t:0"Stab in the Back"
  UaCH.35.d:0"The Empire after the death of §GShah Rukh§! fell into a chaotic succession. While most of the fighting has died down by now, the ripples are still felt everywhere. §GRoot.Monarch.GetName§! has attempted to resolve the issues between the various factions and emirs, even going as far as alienating his own son §GAbdal-Aziz§!. Though it seems all of this was in vain, as even someone as loyal as §GAbu Sa'id§! seems to have developed new ideas. Previously posted on the northern front, he abandoned his post, and gathered a small number of clansmen to raid the city of Samarkand."
  UaCH.35.a:0"Alas, ambition is the enemy of man."
 
  UaCH.36.t:0"Gawhar Shad under fire"
  UaCH.36.d:0"§GShah Rukh's§! dowager empress, his first consort §GGawhar Shad§! has always played a prominent part in our internal politics. While undoubtebly loyal to his husband, there is little doubt she has taken an active hand in the succession crisis unfolding after his death. Even though most of the Princes are blood-related, none would miss an opportunity to capture her, if only to prove his legitimacy. And now, like a gift from heavens, she has fallen into our hands."
  UaCH.36.a:0"Ensnare her!"
 
  UaCH.37.t:0"The Fate of Gawhar Shad"
  UaCH.37.d:0"§GGawhar Shad§! has always been an ambitious woman. Since early young age, she actively worked behind the screens to meddle in politics, supporting her choice of heir's rather than his husbands. Old age did not really change this fact, and it is obvious that she has had her hand in the current events. Now that we have her in custody, it might be prudent to solve this nuisance once and for all..."
  UaCH.37.a:0"She cannot be trusted alive."
  UaCH.37.b:0"She's just and old woman."
 
  UaCH.38.t:0"Supplies running out"
  UaCH.38.d:0"Due to the advance of the front, and the constant raids from the surrounding tribes, we find ourselves unable to resupply from home. Even through the horses can still graze, the soldiers are finding increasingly hard to forage. The population also began to hide whatever food they manage to get, making the situation even worse."
  UaCH.38.a:0"Find supplies by any means neccessary."
  UaCH.38.b:0"We'll just have to go hungry, men. "

  UaCH.39.t:0"Policies of local Emir"
  UaCH.39.d:0"Most of the time, the high nobility doesn't care about the happenings of the populace, unless it grows into a direct rebellion against them. However, it has come to our attention that a local Emir has tripled the previous years taxes, holding abundant feasts and festivities. While his contributions to our coffers are also significant, we cannot lose the support of the suburbs either."
  UaCH.39.a:0"Replace the emir."
  UaCH.39.b:0"Give the emir a stern talking to."
  UaCH.39.c:0"They're right, though!"
 
  UaCH.40.t:0"Defections"
  UaCH.40.d:0"My liege, I bring the most grave news! We have received a letter from the general of our armies, it seems some nobles have decided to mutiny despite swearing loyalty to our cause!"
  UaCH.40.a:0"Traitors! "
  UaCH.40.b:0"Surely, we can just bribe them..."
  UaCH.40.c:0"Make concessions."
 
  UaCH.41.t:0"Flight of the Western Emirs"
  UaCH.41.d:0"The bloodshed has been going on forever, without end in sight. Quite a few emirs have already died,either on the field of battle or due to mysterious illness, creating a power vacuum in the western parts of the Empire. However, there seems to be a power, albeit foreign, that could turn the tide in our favor, if we are willing to pay its price. Let us turn to the nomadic §YQara Qoyunlu§! for support."
  UaCH.41.a:0"Now may be time to call in some favors..."
  UaCH.41.b:0"Relying on Turkic raiders? What, are we fools?"
 
  UaCH.42.t:0"Call of the Glory"
  UaCH.42.d:0"Our ruler, §G[Root.Monarch.GetName]§!, despite our dire warnings have decided to take matters into his own hand. It seems he believes that going out to the field of battle by himself should change the outcome of every battle drastically. While the men's morale is certainly bolstered by his boldness, the risks are equally great, and the consequences equally catastrophic, should he fall."
  UaCH.42.a:0"Now, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], is this not a little hasty?"
 
  UaCH.43.t:0"Tragedy on the Battlefield"
  UaCH.43.d:0"What we were afraid of has happened! Our ruler, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] §G[Root.Monarch.GetName]§! has fallen on the battlefield to foreign arms, and while our troops have managed to recover his body the following chaos forced their retreat. The unexpected demise of our ruler has left us with no clear succession, as he has not designated a heir."
  UaCH.43.a:0"Don't you traitors get any ideas!"
  UaCH.43.b:0"A bastard is still a heir!"
  UaCH.43.c:0"He's clearly fit to rule!"
  UaCH.43.d:0"At least we have a new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take charge..."
 
  UaCH.44.t:0"General turned traitor"
  UaCH.44.d:0"In the midst of the succession crisis, many lowborn are forced to serve in either the armies or turn mercenary. While war is an inherently deathly occupation, some find opportunities to rise in the ranks, either by valor or by betrayal. One of our appointed viziers got definitely strange ideas into his head, proclaiming himself Emir, with the support of a fair part of our army. He began to fortify the nearby villages and send out tax collectors to set up his nice little kingdom."
  UaCH.44.a:0"So, that is how it is going to be..."
 
  UaCH.45.t:0"A Scheming Regent"
  UaCH.45.d:0"Behind a facade of grace lies a mind sharp as a scimitar, plotting, scheming, and orchestrating the grand dance of power with the finesse of a master conductor. Our regent has made his move to grab power from our rightful emir."
  UaCH.45.a:0"This will not do."
  UaCH.45.b:0"Uncle?"
 
  UaCH.46.t:0"Regent imprisons the heir"
  UaCH.46.d:0"Our regent has made his move, imprisoning the rightful heir to secure their own ascent to the throne. The palace guard has sided with the regent, but there may be some resistance in the court to his boldness."
  UaCH.46.a:0"Attempt to bring any dissenters to the regent's side."
  UaCH.46.b:0"Side with the imprisoned heir"
 
  UaCH.47.t:0"Opposition to the Regent"
  UaCH.47.d:0"Our regent has imprisoned the rightful heir to the throne, however he has underestimated the loyalty of this people. Even now, the local emirs are preparing to storm the palace to free the prince, with support gathering from all over the country."
  UaCH.47.a:0"One man's ambition is the doom of us all..."
 
  UaCH.48.t:0"Gawhar Shad's Demands"
  UaCH.48.d:0"The empress dowager §GGawhar Shad§! has taken up residence in our city. While many see this as strenghtening our claim to the throne, those who know of her know that this may be just another scheme in her book. She has made multiple demands to our ruler, and while they seem reasonable, the outcome of agreeing to such actions is yet to be seen."
  UaCH.48.a:0"Accede to the demands"
  UaCH.48.b:0"She's way past her expiration date..."

 
  UaCH.49.t:0"Abdal-Latif complies"

  UaCH.51.t:0"Abdul-Latif's demands"
  UaCH.51.d:0"Abdal-Latif is torn between loyalty to his father and his own ambitions. He ponders if we were offer him not only his fathers realm which is his birthright, he may consider siding with our cause."
  UaCH.51.a:0"Offer him riches beyond measure. "
  UaCH.51.b:0"Offer him lands and titles. "

  UaCH.60.t: "The Great Migration"
  UaCH.60.d: "It appears the discontent of the Kazakh tribes has boiled over, with the two co-chieftains, Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan, having begun a migration into the lands of Mogulistan, seeking support from abroad. They still claim their lands under our rule as theirs despite the migration, which is clearly a vagrant act of disobidience on top of the migration out of our lands into the lands of one of our enemies.\n\nWhilst this has soured our relations with them, the bigger concern is how the Khans of Moghulistan will respond. Should they back this act of rebellion, it is likely that the Kazakhs will grow to become a threat to our hold on power in the region, and may even give the Taighuibs of Sibir, who have been quelled for the mean time, ideas."
  UaCH.60.a:0 "Let them run... we will wait."

  UaCH.61.t:0 "The Great Migration"
  UaCH.61.d:0 "It appears that the Kazakh khans have grown tired of being naught but a small corner of a growing tribal power on the Steppe, and have left for greener pastures elsewhere, namely, our own lands. They request that we give them our support in a future war of reconquest against the Shaybanids, who are likely to attempt to press claim to the lands they have largely left behind. By granting them our support, we will gain a powerful ally, but will also end up hurting ourselves to assist 2 khans who may end up being nothing more than vipers that will suck us dry and leave us for dead."
  UaCH.61.a:0 "We will back their endeavors."

  UaCH.61.b:0 "We have greater concerns than these tribal feuds."

  UaCH.62.t:0 "Care of the Empress-Dowager"
  UaCH.62.d:0 "In Shah Rukh's twilight years full of illness, Gawhar Shad has grown to become his main caretaker. Whilst not particularly unusual, the closeness the two share is rather unusual, given that the marriage started political in nature in order for a group of notables in Herat to appease Shah Rukh. However, the reason for the marriage matters not anymore, for the two truly care for eachother, and Gawhar Shad has taken more responsibility than ever before to ensure that order is maintained.\n\nWhilst all know that Shah Rukh's time looms, it is Gawhar Shad who has arguably kept him alive for this long, despite her schemeing regarding his succession. No doubt that Shah Rukh is grateful to have someone who cares enough to be by his side even as he nears his final breath."
  UaCH.62.a:0 "A truly beautiful marriage of love."

  UaCH.63.t:0 "Patronage of Shah Rukh and Gawhar Shad"
  UaCH.63.d:0 "If there is one thing that Shah Rukh has become known for, it's the patronage of the arts and Persian culture that has occurred under his rule, with the assistance of his favorite wife, Gawhar Shad. The court has been moved from Samarkand to Herat in order to better establish a Persianized state, the Persian language has replaced Chagatai as the main language of government, and a vibrant court of artists, architects, and poets has been maintained. Under their joint patronage, elaborate mosques have been built in Herat and Mashhad, with a distinct mixture of cultural styles. Literature, much like government, has become primarily Persian once more, with Chagatai and Arabic still holding major sway as well. Islamic law has superseded the Mongol law Timur put in place, and the state has become far more concerned with portraying itself as a proper Iranian state. Already, Iran has once again began to prosper, and if Shah Rukh's successor keeps this patronage of the arts in place, it is likely that the Timurid state will become not unlike those before it that became nothing more than another Persian empire.\n\nSadly, given the scheming of the Princes, this prosperity seems to be nothing but a brief glimmer of hope..."
