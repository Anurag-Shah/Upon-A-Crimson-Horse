 uach_let_them_do_their_thing: "Shiite Conversions"
 uach_reform.1000.t: "Shia Imams prosletyze"
 uach_reform.1000.d: "The Shia faith, while a minority in our country, has recently become a thorn in our side. Their prosletyzing has raised eyebrows in our court, especially among the Ulama. Inaction will certainly create opposition to us in our court. However, cracking down on this conversion will draw the ire of the new converts."
 uach_reform.1000.a: "Let the Shiites be"
 uach_reform.1000.b: "We must crack down on the heretics"
 
 uach_reform.1001.t: "General found plotting against us!"
 uach_reform.1001.d: "One of our trusted generals has been found plotting against the Monarch, or so several courtiers have reported. The general himself insists that he has nothing to do with this plot, and openly swears loyalty to the King. Shall we eliminate this potential threat, or shall we trust his word and hope nothing comes of it?"
 uach_reform.1001.a: "Execute him!"
 uach_reform.1001.b: "Give him a stern talking to."
 
 uach_reform.1002.t: "Scholars in the Capital"
 uach_reform.1002.d: "After the bloody and devestating succession crisis, our court is slowly rebuilding itself and returning to the finer pursuits. Recently, some scholars have arrived asking for our patronage. Should we fund their studies, it will certainly help us return to our cultural height, and help stabilize our court."
 uach_reform.1002.a: "Let us fund their studies!"
 uach_reform.1002.b: "We cannot afford this expense"
 uach_scholars_in_capital: "Patronage of Scholars"
 
 uach_reform.1003.t: "Persian Music in our Court"
 uach_reform.1003.d: "Persian Music has been growing in favor in our court, especially among those courtiers not of Timurid or Turkmen origin. It seems these complex, classical compositions hold some value, either as entertainment, or some deeper and more profound meaning, to much of our Court. We should consider lending our Royal Patronage to this growing movement."
 uach_reform.1003.a: "I love it, lets hire more musicians!"
 uach_reform.1003.b: "I prefer the good old throat singing."
 uach_throat_singing:  "Throat Singing"

 uach_reform.1004.t: "Claims on our Neighbors"
 uach_reform.1004.d: "The Timurid Empire used to be much larger than it is today, and we have an ancestral right to the majority of the surrounding land. Recently, one of our courtiers uncovered a document that strongly tied the ownership of some neighboring land to our realm. We can make use of this claim, and possibly press it in war if we need to."
 uach_reform.1004.a: "It is rightfully ours"
 uach_reform.1004.b: "Let us focus on peace and stability"

 uach_reform.1005.t: "Soldiers want to return home"
 uach_reform.1005.d: "After the Succession Crisis, none of our population is willing to fight. Still, we compel them, and ride to war. Now, many of our Soldiers demand that they have been campaigning for long enough, and want to return to the comfort of their homes. Shall we allow them to leave and hinder our war effort, or shall we compel to stay and deal with the desertions and reduced morale?"
 uach_reform.1005.a: "Let them go home"
 uach_reform.1005.b: "Demand they stay and fight"
 uach_solidiers_went_home: "Dwindling manpower"
 uach_soldiers_had_to_stay : "Forced Conscription"

 uach_reform.1006.t: "Fasting during Ramazan"
 uach_reform.1006.d: "Recently, an issue surrounding the fasting period of Ramazan has come to the forefront of court politics. The Ulama insist that as pious Muslims, all must take part in the fast. But many of our Princes and Nobles, aligning more closely to their Mongol or Turkmen roots, only pay lip service to the fasting, and even indulge in daytime feasts. Both sides have come to us, demanding we take a stance on the matter."
 uach_reform.1006.a: "Enforce fasting"
 uach_reform.1006.b: "Let the Princes be"

 uach_reform.1007.t: "Raids from the Turkmen"
 uach_reform.1007.d: "Raids from the Turkmen will never truly cease, will they? It seems raiding us is all they ever do. Well, they only give us two paths forward. We can either choose to raid them back, or we can choose to fortify our border against them."
 uach_reform.1007.a: "Raid them in retaliation!"
 uach_reform.1007.b: "Bolster our border defenses"
 uach_raid_turks_back_lol : "Raids against the Turkmen"
 uach_bolster_defenses : "Fortified border"

 uach_reform.1008.t: "Campaign against the Turkmen"
 uach_reform.1008.d: "Our efforts to deal with the Turkmen raids have had little impact. Furthermore, a new ruler has arisen in the west, who seems to have territorial aspirations on our land. Uzun Hasan, as he is known, is extremely unpopular in our court. Some of our Monarch's closest advisors have suggested a campaign against the Turkmen: to teach them their place, and to reconquer some of the land Timur once held. But a few in the court see this as a ridiculous expense and dangerous proposition, and say we should focus on our internal situation instead. What will our path forward be?"
 uach_reform.1008.a: "It is time to teach these Turkmen a lesson"
 uach_reform.1008.b: "We have bigger things to worry about"

 uach_reform.1009.t: "The Language of the Timurid Court"
 uach_reform.1009.d: "In our country, two langauges are spoken among the upper classes, and within our court. There is Chagatai, a Turkic language spoken by the Mongols of old in the once-mighty Chagatai Khanate. There is also Persian, the language of the people, and a language connected to a rich literary and cultural tradition, that would be a great benefit to our state. As the ruler, it is up to us to prioritize the language we prefer."
 uach_reform.1009.a: "Chagatai is OUR language!"
 uach_reform.1009.b: "Speaking Persian has many benefits"
 
 uach_reform.1009.t: "The Language of the Timurid Court"
 uach_reform.1009.d: "In our country, two langauges are spoken among the upper classes, and within our court. There is Chagatai, a Turkic language spoken by the Mongols of old in the once-mighty Chagatai Khanate. There is also Persian, the language of the people, and a language connected to a rich literary and cultural tradition, that would be a great benefit to our state. As the ruler, it is up to us to prioritize the language we prefer."
 uach_reform.1009.a: "Chagatai is OUR language!"
 uach_reform.1009.b: "We must switch to Persian"

 uach_reform.1010.t: "The Al Saray Palace"
 uach_reform.1010.d: "While our ruler does not frequently indulge in the grandiose construction projects of our predecessors, one plan has caught his attention. The Al Saray Palace, planned to be built in Shahrisabz, the birthplace of Timur himself, is an ambitious project that will no doubt cost us dearly to build. While it would be unpopular in the court, it would certainly help us assert our power and independence."
 uach_reform.1010.a: "Build the palace!"
 uach_reform.1010.b: "Lets spend the money on our court instead."

 uach_reform.1011.t: "Centralization in [ROOT.GetName]"
 uach_reform.1011.d: "Our policies of increasing centralization have caught the ire of our court, with many officials demanding we back down on our reforms. However, the path forward towards a reformed state requires centralization, and it would do our regime a great benefit if we were to enforce a central authority with an iron fist."
 uach_reform.1011.a: "An iron fist, like Timur"
 uach_reform.1011.b: "Let's smell the flowers"

 uach_reform.1012.t: "Investments in Agriculture"
 uach_reform.1012.d: "Our ruler's interest in agriculture and farming is well known to all. His focus on the welfare of the peasants has not been overly popular in the court but has been a matter of great pride among the common people, and has greatly increased the stability of our realm. This time, the Royal Architects propose a major dam construction on the Golestan River, combined with irrigation systems (including the Juy-i Sultani Canal near Herat), and several tax provisions, to encourage more farming in the west of our realm. Shall we give these plans the royal stamp?"
 uach_reform.1012.a: "This will be an excellent investment"
 uach_reform.1012.b: "Bah, let the peasants be"

 uach_reform.1013.t: "A Cruel Monarch"
 uach_reform.1013.d: "Our ruler is known for his cruelty, and his lack of mercy. This time, an advisor has drawn his ire through his communications with our Turkmen rivals to the west. Though he insists they are not at all treasonous and much of our court supports him, our Ruler wishes to execute him and make an example in any case. The common people will of course be delighted by the execution of an official that is in regular correspondance with our rivals."
 uach_reform.1013.a: "ONLY I RULE IN THE TIMURID STATE"
 uach_reform.1013.b: "Give in the court's requests"

 uach_reform.1014.t: "Ulama opposes Reforms"
 uach_reform.1014.d: "In an attempt to progress the reforms in the state, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has angered the Ulama, who oppose some reforms on religious grounds. We can give in to their demands, though this will set us back in our plan to reform the state. Alternatively, we could push forward, though this will anger the Ulama."
 uach_reform.1014.a: "The wise men have spoken"
 uach_reform.1014.b: "Babbling fools!"
 uach_no_talking_back_to_clergy: "Gave in to Ulama Demands"
 uach_daring_today: "Refused Ulama Demands"

 uach_reform.1015.t: "Rebellion in Shahrukhiyya"
 uach_reform.1015.d: "A local lord in Shahrukhiyya has raised his flag in rebellion. Shahrukhiyya is an important city, named by Timur himself after his fourth son, and a cultural center in the north of our realm. We could negotiate with this lord, grant him some autonomy in exchange for an end to his rebellion. Or, we could rally our armies and place the city under seige, and force this upstart to surrender."
 uach_reform.1015.a: "Attack the city!"
 uach_reform.1015.b: "Negotiate a peaceful surrender"

 uach_reform.1016.t: "A Matter of Clan and State"
 uach_reform.1016.d: "Before we ruled over Persia, we were Mongols. While we live in Persia, and may be slowly accepting the cultural realities of our position, the clan, an important Turco-Mongol institution, remains central in our regime. We must carefully consider the precedence and power we give to our Clan, and how it measures against our state."
 uach_reform.1016.a: "Clan above state"
 uach_reform.1016.b: "State above Clan"
 uach_state_above_clan: "State above Clan"
