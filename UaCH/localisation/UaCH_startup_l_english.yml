Timur's death sent shockwaves through his empire, leading to a chaotic sucession period. By 1414, his youngest son, the gentle §GShah Rukh Mirza§! managed to consolidate, but the western part of the empire was lost. Shah Rukh focused on the internal stability of the empire, alienating the nobility. His son @TRS §GUlugh Beg§!, Prince of Transoxiana, famous for his scientific work, rules wisely, albeit weak-handed.\nHowever in the 1440's, Shah Rukh has fallen ill multiple times, prompting his uncles and cousins to plot and prepare for a gathering storm. For no sultan rules forever."
