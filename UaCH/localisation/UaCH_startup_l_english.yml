 UPON_A_CHRIMSON_HORSE_DESC:0"§RI had a vision in the night, and behold, a man riding on a crimson horse...§!\nIn the early 1405, §GTimur the Lame§!, conqueror of Persia, ruler of the land from Anatolia to Delhi, captor of the Ottoman Sultan §GBayezid I§!, has died in his winter camp. Timur's death sent shockwaves through his empire, leading to a chaotic sucession period. By 1414, his youngest son, the gentle §GShah Rukh Mirza§!,has managed to consolidate, but the western part of the empire was lost. Shah Rukh focused on the internal stability of the empire, alienating the nobility. His son §GUlugh beg§!, Prince of Transoxiana, famous for his scientific work, rules wisely, albeit weak-handed.\nHowever in the 1440's, Shah Rukh has fallen ill multiple times, prompting his uncles and cousins to plot and prepare for a gathering storm.For no sultan rules forever."

After Timurs death, his youngest son, §YShahrukh Mirza§! managed to hold onto most of the territories, focusing on internal stability.
