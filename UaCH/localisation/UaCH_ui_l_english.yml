Whilst not viewed as a worthy successor of the @TIM §YTimurids§!, they seek to forge their own bloody path through Iran and establish a state of their own.\n\n§YGovernors§!, whilst having weaker government mechanics, are able to '§YEnd Timur's Legacy§!'. If they so wish, they may also attempt to elevate themselves into being a §YPrince§! by using '§YEnthrone Timurid Claimant§!'."
    timurids_map_slot_tooltip: "§YInterlopers§! are outside powers that intervene to seize control of one of the regions below, and who perhaps will grow to have greater ambitions revolving around picking away at the corpse of the @TIM §YTimurids§!.
